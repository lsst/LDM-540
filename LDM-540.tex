\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document specifies the test procedure for the \product{}.

The \product{} is the component of the LSST system which is responsible for providing data access and data analysis capabilities to users.

It is aimed at meeting the needs of several categories of users, including:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Science users with LSST data rights;}
  \item{LSST Project, and later, Operations staff doing algorithm development and the associated validations;}
  \item{LSST Project staff engaged in Commissioning and related activities; and}
  \item{LSST Operations staff engaged in science validation and other data quality analyses}

\end{itemize}

A full description of this product is provided in \citeds{LDM-542}, with requirements enumerated in \citeds{LDM-554}.

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

This document builds on the description of LSST Data Management's approach to testing as described in \citeds{LDM-503} to describe the detailed tests that will be performed on the \product{} as part of the verification of the DM system.

It identifies test designs, test cases and procedures for the tests, and the pass/fail criteria for each test.

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}

This document describes the test procedures for the following components of the LSST system (as described in \citeds{LDM-542}), and their deployment over the resources and services of the LSST Data Facility:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{The science database, especially its Qserv component;}
  \item{The API Aspect of the Science Platform, comprising:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Catalog query via TAP and related VO services;}
      \item{Image metadata query via TAP and SIAv2;}
      \item{Image retrieval and cutout generation;}
      \item{User Workspace database creation and access; and}
      \item{User Workspace file system access.}
    \end{itemize}
  }

  \item{The Portal Aspect of the Science Platform, comprising a set of Web-based tools for:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Data discovery for Project-generated and user-generated data;}
      \item{Catalog and image query;}
      \item{Image display;}
      \item{Catalog data visualization;}
      \item{Exploratory data analysis; and}
      \item{Alert subscription control.}
    \end{itemize}
  }

  \item{The Notebook Aspect of the Science Platform, comprising:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{A deployment of the JupyterHub and JupyterLab interactive computing environments;}
      \item{Access to the API Aspect services from within that environment;}
      \item{Direct access to elements of the data systems underlying those services, e.g., access to the User File Workspace as a mounted filesystem rather than through the VOSpace API;}
      \item{A customizable, persistent user environment; and}
      \item{The provision of pre-built deployments of releases of the LSST Stack, usable to configure the computational environment provided by JupyterLab.}
    \end{itemize}

  }

\end{itemize}

\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

The major activities to be performed are to:

\begin{itemize}

\item{Verify that the LSST Science Platform components are capable of performing the functions defined in the relevant DM System Requirements, \citeds{LSE-61}, and in the Science Platform Requirements, \citeds{LDM-554}.}
\item{Ensure that the components of the Science Platform match the documented design.}
\item{Test all the interfaces among components of the Science Platform.}
\item{Test all the interfaces between components of the Science Platform and other DM system components.}
\item{Within the limits of available integration and test hardware platforms and datasets, verify that the Science Platform components meet the performance requirements set forth in the above documents, or extrapolate appropriately from the test systems available to verify that the performance requirements should be met on a fully provisioned hardware platform.}
\item{Repeat these tests when the full hardware platform becomes available.}
\item{Ensure that the test procedures developed are also relevant to pre-deployment testing in the Operations era.}
\item{Ensure that the observed behavior of the Science Platform components when under test is consistent with the available documentation produced by their developers or by other authors.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tasks and criteria}
\label{sec:tasks}

The following are the major items under test:

\begin{itemize}

\item{The LSST science database;}
\item{The API Aspect of the Science Platform, encompassing Web APIs for access to LSST Data Products, both within the science database and within the Data Backbone, and enabling the creation, sharing, and management of User Generated Data Products;}
\item{The Portal Aspect of the Science Platform, encompassing user interfaces for data discovery, retrieval, visualization, and exploratory data analysis, as well as an interface for the control of the alert subscription and ``mini-broker'' filtering mechanism; and}
\item{The Notebook Aspect of the Science Platform, providing interactive computing services for LSST science users and project-internal analysts.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features to be tested}
\label{sec:feat2test}

\begin{itemize}

\item{Availability and, where relevant, proper interpretation of Prompt Data Products through each Aspect of the Science Platform;}
\item{Availability and, where relevant, proper interpretation of Data Release Data Products through each Aspect of the Science Platform;}
\item{Creation of, access to, and management of User Generated Data Products through each Aspect of the Science Platform;}
\item{Features related to authentication and authorization of users, including those related to custom access controls to User Generated Data Products;}
\item{Features related to the manageability of the Science Platform as an operational service; and}
\item{Integration of the components of the Science Platform with each other and with the underlying services on which they run.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features not to be tested}
\label{sec:featnot2test}

This document does not describe facilities for periodically generating or collecting key performance metrics (KPMs), except insofar as those KPMs are incidentally measured as part of executing the documented testcases. 
The KPMs and the system being used to track KPMs and to ensure compliance with documented requirements are described in \citeds{LDM-502}.

\subsection{Pass/fail criteria}
\label{sec:passfail}

The results of all tests will be assessed using the criteria described in \citeds{LDM-503} \S4.

Note that, when executing pipelines, tasks or individual algorithms, any unexplained or unexpected errors or warnings appearing in the associated log or on screen output must be described in the documentation for the system under test. 
Any warning or error for which this is not the case must be filed as a software problem report and filed with the DMCCB.

\subsection{Suspension criteria and resumption requirements}
\label{suspension}

Refer to individual test cases where applicable.

\subsection{Naming convention}

All tests are named according to the pattern \textsc{prod-xx-yy} where:

%% \begin{description}[font=\normalfont\scshape]

%%   \item[prod]{The product under test. Relevant entries for this document are:
%%     \begin{description}[font=\normalfont\scshape,topsep=-1.0ex]
%%       \item[AA]{The A A}
%%     \end{description}
%%   }
%%   \item[xx]{Test specification number (in increments of 10)}
%%   \item[yy]{Test case number (in increments of 5)}

%% \end{description}
